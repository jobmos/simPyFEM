SimPyFEM is a simple finite element Python 3 code built for educational purposes. 
This is a direct translation from the Fortran 90 version of simpleFEM by Cedric Thielot.
It showcases functional illustrations of the various features of a FEM code: the mesh and its connectivity, the shape functions and their derivatives, the numerical integration, the assembly phase, imposing the boundary conditions, and the system solve.
